    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions and cook until translucent. Sprinkle the flour over the onions, cooking and stirring for 1-2 minutes or until the mixture begins to golden.</li>
            <li>Slowly whisk in the chicken stock, stirring constantly and allowing mixture to thicken. Add half & half and continue to stir.</li>
            <li>Add the broccoli and carrots. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20-25 minutes or until the broccoli and carrots are tender.</li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper to taste, as well as the optional nutmeg to bring out extra flavor. For a smoother soup, remove 1-2 cups of soup and blend until smooth before returning to the soup.</li>
            <li>Add the cheese to the soup while still on low heat, stirring to melt. Note: the soup can become grainy if the heat is too high.</li>
            <li>Serve soup with crusty bread.</li>
