    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake liners.</li>
            <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk the oil, eggs, brown sugar, pumpkin puree, and vanilla extract together until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and use a mixer or whisk until completely combined. Batter will be thick.</li>
            <li>Pour/spoon the batter into the liners, filling only 2.3 full to avoid spilling over the sides while baking. Bake for 20-22 minutes, or until a toothpick insertyed in the center comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the frosting:</strong> In a large bowlusing a handhelf or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add 3 cups of confectioners' sugar, the vanilla and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. If you want the frosting to be a little thicker, add the extra 1/4 cup of confectioners' sugar and continue mixing.</li>
            <li>Frost cooled cupcakes however you'd like. Use a large round piping tip and piping bag to make it look like photo. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
